One of the highlights of my professional growth has been the exposure to effective collaboration and cross-communication with both onshore and offshore teams, as well as external and internal stakeholders. This experience has provided me with valuable perspectives on fostering productive interactions within a global and multifaceted organizational context. Recognizing the significance of continuous learning and development, I seized the opportunity to enhance my skills by pursuing and obtaining the Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) certification from the Scrum Alliance. This certification has fortified my grasp of agile product management practices and underscores my commitment to staying abreast of industry-relevant methodologies. In summary, my post-graduate journey has been characterized by a dynamic exploration of product management, proficiency in SCRUM and AGILE methodologies, and effective collaboration within a diverse and interconnected professional landscape.
